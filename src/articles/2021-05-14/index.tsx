      <p>
        I've been playing World of Warcraft on and off since 2009 - that's end of Wrath of the Lich King for anyone curious. I've played at pretty much every level in some way or shape. I've built up friendships, destroyed guilds, burned out, obsessed, and everything in between with this game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, however, I'm in a weird spot. I still have an active account. I enjoy playing with my wife, but I can't seem to figure exactly why I'm playing.
      </p>
      <p>
        See, I used to play for the social aspect. I played to hang out with my guild mates and tackle tough bosses. We'd chat about life and whatnot in guild chat or over Vent / TeamSpeak. Then that all ended in Warlords of Draenor when I first went from full time student to part time employee. I couldn't make raids because I worked nights. And when I had the time to play, I was burdened by living out in the middle of no where with my parents.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I moved out on my own in the Legion times, I tried to get back into things, but it never stuck. My old guild had moved on to other games, and I had developed a massive amount of anxiety when trying to interact with the new Mythic + system that everyone else was doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Battle for Azeroth and so far through Shadowlands, I've just existed. I'll pop on every couple of months, obsess for a bit, burn out, and repeat. I've been trying to figure out why I keep coming back. I used to think it was the story, but honestly, BfA and Shadowlands haven't impressed me (but that's a topic for another time).  
      </p>
      <p>
        But, with this new idea on this blog, I've been doing some introspection on how I want to spend my  time, and I believe I've figured out the root problem. I'm a completionist, and WoW preys on that.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Completion-ism
      </h3>
      <p>
        From the very beginning of WoW, you had various little bars that tracked your reputation with various factions. The bar would (typically) start with a neutral yellow, then progress to happy green bars as you gained reputation. These were fine, but then they added achievements in Wrath of the Lich King. Now, you had all these other things to try to complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, still not too bad. Achievements, if not overdone, can be a really handy way of guiding players to more difficult or hidden content. They can also be used to show what you've managed to do, but this should basically be reserved for super high difficulties. To take the WoW example, you don't need an achievement for clearing a dungeon on heroic (anymore), but probably should have one for a Mythic 15 key.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, after achievements came more collections. Cataclysm brought about transmog, Mists of Pandaria united achievements to not be character-specific but account-wide. It also unified mounts (I think), and brought about battle pets. All other expansions would expand upon these systems with toys, more gear, more pets and mounts, and ultimately, more characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of these things seem harmless, but they're actually very problematic for someone like me. Remember those little reputation bars from three paragraphs ago. Having even 10 an expansion wasn't too bad, but now I effectively had six different sets of those bars - one for actual faction reputation, another for achievements, one for collectible gear, one for mounts, another for pets, and another for toys. To make matters worse, one character usually couldn't actually complete all of these things - you needed multiple characters for gear alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I did what I always do, turned to spreadsheets, planned, and structured my game time around playing a video game that wasn't challenging, wasn't interesting, and ultimately, wasn't fun anymore.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Manipulative Design
      </h3>
      <p>
        I've never enjoyed going on the WoW forums or on Reddit to see people complaining about the current expansion. The most vocal people are often the upset minority - happy people don't write long ass blog posts about why they're happy, though maybe they should.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, looking at these systems from afar, it's easy to see WoW's design as somewhat manipulative, even if it's accidental. Games like WoW, which get $15 a month from each active player need to keep players active. So, what do they do? They add more stuff for you to do after you beat the raids! Now you can farm mounts and battle pets, or level up another character and get a new armor set. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I imagine a lot of people have no problem saying "I won't have everything" and putting down WoW when they're bored, but I struggle with that for reasons. I want to complete the game, but the game is never ending, so I keep playing, even when I'm bored.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where the design becomes manipulative. I'm not actively working on anything difficult, nor am I experiencing a new story, but still I play because I want to complete these collections. Activision-Blizzard knows this is true, and so they'll keep adding more stuff, never actually addressing the problem within the game culture they've created. Why? Because the suits see active subscribers and tell the devs to keep it up.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Fixing the Problem
      </h3>
      <p>
        For me, fixing the problem is pretty easy - I stop playing. Honestly, I'm not losing much anymore. I have dreams of my perfect WoW, but I think those are just that - dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Activision-Blizzard, the problem is a lot harder to fix. Similar to how, in hindsight, they hated the addition of flying mounts, a lot of these systems would be all but impossible to back out now. Players have been amassing virtual trophies for well over a decade now. You can't just rip them out. Honestly, Classic was the best chance Activision-Blizzard had at fixing the problem, but it seems they've learned nothing with Burning Crusade...
      </p>
      <p>
        The way I see, the only way to save the World of Warcraft is to start over. WoW 2.0. Take the lessons learned with the massive success of WoW Classic, and build upon.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Reputations / Honor / Experience - all fine! This is where your progression is locked.
        </li>
        <li>
          Achievements - Only for the hardest shit
        </li>
        <li>
          Transmog - Take a Cata approach and force players to use Void Storage for transmog.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mounts - Ground mounts only, very limited, character specific.
        </li>
        <li>
          Battle Pets - Cut em! Little companions are like mounts - rare and character specific.
        </li>
        <li>
          Toys - Just like mounts - rare and character specific.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And this hasn't even touched on the actual game play problems that are ruining the end game. That's a post for another time. If I were Activision-Blizzard, I'd tell the Activision part to fuck right off, get some of the old guard back in the office, and take WoW Classic as an example of what to do, and build WoW 2.0 with all the good in modern WoW, but none of the ridiculous amounts of collections.
      </p>

      <h3>
        In Conclusion
      </h3>
      <p>
        I'm done with WoW - again - for who knows how long. Maybe in a couple of months when patch 9.1 finally hits, I'll resub for the sake of seeing the death of Sylvannas in person. Maybe not.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the time I've freed, I've been playing through Dark Souls after hyper-fixating on the lore of the Soulsborne games. Maybe one day, I'll make my own WoW. I've definitely been inspired a lot by the Warcraft universe, and I'm sure those things will show up in my work.
