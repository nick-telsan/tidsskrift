      <p>This past week has been particularly hard for me. Ever since we moved, I've had a lot of trouble sleeping. This week it's been worse than usual. I think I've finally gotten over the hump. This post is primarily a reflection on what's been bothering me and what I'm doing to fix it.</p>

      <h2>Problem 1: Lack of Sleep</h2>
      <p>This one is a bit tricky to fix. I don't usually have trouble falling asleep, but I frequently wake up, and when I do, I'm usually up for a minute unless I can drown my thoughts in noise. Literally, I keep Futurama on all the time so that I can sleep. Healthiest thing to do? Probably not, but it works for me.</p>
      <p>Caffeine hasn't been the problem, either. I've been making sure to stop drinking any caffeine before 8, so by 12, it should be mostly out of my system.</p>
      <p>So, what am I doing differently? I'm going to get back to my evening tea, reflection, and calming down ritual.</p>
      <p>11:00 pm - feed / medicate the cats, do the dishes</p>
      <p>11:30 pm - make a cup of peppermint tea, sit down in living room, and reflect on the day</p>
      <p>This reflection isn't a time for what did I do wrong or right, but just something that stuck out in the day or some trivial thought to explore. It's meditation, not preparation.</p>
      <p>My hope is that by settling down a bit with some meditation, I can fall asleep and stay asleep.</p>
      <p>P.S. I know losing some weight will help with this so...</p>

      <h2>Problem 2: Eating Habits</h2>
      <p>Before we moved, I was doing pretty well on my intermitten fasting and was losing weight.</p>
      <p>Then we got ready to move, I got off schedule, and have struggled to get back on schedule.</p>
      <p>So, this week - fasting time is from 8 pm to 12 pm. That means I can have lunch and dinner at a normal time.</p>
      <p>I also need to get better about actually eating a real dinner. Several times this week, I've just gone with a bubble tea for dinner, then I get really snacky late in the evening. Let's not do that anymore.</p>

      <h2>Problem 3: Too Much Time in the Office</h2>
      <p>In June, I'll be able to go to the office (hopefully).</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I want to make sure I'm spending at least some time outside of the office. Excluding my Mac Mini, everything I have is portable, so there's no excuse for me not setting up in the living room or dnd room for a bit other than mess.</p>
      <p>So, step one is to pick up both rooms and keep them reasonably clean.</p>
      <p>Step two is spend any non-gaming time in one of those rooms. There's definitely somethings that I won't be able to do outside my office space, but I think I can do most of my hobby work with just my protable monitor.</p>
      <p>Step three is a bit more complicated and is a project unto itself. Right now, we have basically no space in our yard. It's not "our" yard, but still...</p>
      <p>I want to set up a patio area. Our house kinda makes a "u" shape. The inside of the "u" would be a great place for a little patio. I also want to plant a few trees in the backyard.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I think I'll find a local park to go wallk twice or so a week. I've got some ultimate gym plans, but they're still a couple of months off. I'm using COVID as an excuse, but I just don't want to do too much.</p>

      <h2>Problem 4: Too Much Time on My Hands</h2>
      <p>My motivation to work has been pretty low this week. Quitting WoW has left me feeling a little blah at night.</p>
      <p>So, I haven't known what to do with myself.</p>
      <p>Fixing this is mostly a matter of planning. To do lists are my friend and I know that I work best when I keep them up.</p>
      <p>So, I've got a few more items on my to do list. I've been working on fixing up the responsive design of a friend's site, learning Golang, and learning to draw. I also have a lot of DnD work to do.</p>
      <p>The big thing here is to keep myself a list of things I want to do and make sure to set myself time to do them.</p>

      <h2>What Else?</h2>
      <p>There's going to be more posts like these. A kind of progress report, probably in a month or so or whenever I feel it's appropriate.</p>
      <p>Until then, I'm just gonna keep on keeping on.</p>
