    <p>This week had some positives and negatives - as it to be expected... Nothing changes completely overnight.</p>

    <h2>Victory 1: I Finished a Book</h2>
    <p><em>Guards, Guards</em> has been sitting on my nightstand for... two years? I honest don't know. I've been vaguely halfway through it for a while.</p>
    <p>That's not to say I didn't enjoy the book at any point. I just wanted to do other things instead of read. This past weekend, I sat down and read a good bit instead of playing video games.</p>
    <p>On Tuesday, I finally finished it.</p>
    <p>It was good. Plenty of laughs. Good story and twists. Definitely recommend it.</p>
    <p>For less than fun, I'm reading a book on Golang. For slightly more fun, I've got a book on how to draw good. And for actual fun... I don't know... Maybe <em>The Master and Magarita</em>. It's been on my shelf for ages.</p>

    <h2>Loss 1: Work Struggles</h2>
    <p>I've had a couple of tough and annoying tickets at work lately. Nothing I can't handle, but I've been struggling to motivate myself to finish them.</p>
    <p>I think my biggest weakness here is that I need to get better habbits outside of work. Right now, I just don't have motiviation. Which is a problem since I rely on work to, ya know, have a house.</p>

    <h2>Victory 2: I Made Candles</h2>
    <p>Didn't do this with the literal garage door open since it probably looks like I'm doing something illegal, but...</p>
    <p>Last week I ordered a hot plate for the garage. I've had roughly 20 dead candles to process. Melted all the dead wax into a giant ass pot, dumped a massive amount of scented oil into them, and... got a interesting brown candle out of it. Primarily will be using this wax for experiments. It's not for giving people candles.</p>
    <p>I did actually make one candle though. My wife had an old mug she didn't want anymore for reasons. I tried turning it into a two-wick candle, but I think it should have been a three-wick one. Was a good try, though.</p>

    <h2>Loss 2: The General Malaise of Life</h2>
    <p>This is a combination of work struggles and depression talking.</p>
    <p>I'm usually a surprisingly optimistic person. I know that shocks most people, but I generally think things will get better.</p>
    <p>Between the 9 to 5 burning me up and the constant struggles of the political climate (can we please just remove Mitch McTraitor?), I've had a hard time feeling positive about anything this week.</p>
    <p>It doesn't help that the housing market is bonkers dumb right now.</p>
    <p>I know a few things that will help with this. One is a weekend away from the news. The other is spending some time justifying to myself that I will, one day, be able to afford a house.</p>
    <p>Of course, Biden could fix a lot of my issues with the flick of a pen... but... less than hopeful about that.</p>

    <h2>Victory 3: DnD 4e</h2>
    <p>Let's end on a high note!</p>
    <p>I ran our first 4e game in the <em>Nightmare on the Coast</em> campaign!</p>
    <p>It went fine. Awkward-ish, of course, since we're all used to 5e. Still noticed a few issues cropping up in combat that I see in 5e, but that's a story for another time.</p>
    <p>Narratively, editions don't matter, and combat is actually not TOO different, but the framing on 4e is weird compared to 5e. My wife, who is playing a fighter, says that she feels more inclined to describe her attacks when the PHB describes the attacks with words like "Cleave" and "Reaper Strike", which makes sense.</p>
    <p>The rest of the players were also announcing what they were doing a lot more. It was a lot more of "I'm using my encounter ability: whatever" and less of "I'm casting whatever". It seems like they were more interested in the organization of their abilities, but I think that's just a framing thing.</p>
    <p>So far, combat in 4e feels fine. There's some stuff I want to explore more like minions and the inflated hit points of 4e compared to 5e, but that's for another time.</p>

    <h2>What Else?</h2>
    <p>This weekend, I'll be working on stuff for <em>Facilties of Eisolan</em>. Already spent my Friday night working on a friend's static site.</p>
    <p>Might get around to some Golang actual goodies and some drawing. I've got a 3 day weekend</p>
    <p>Of course, I also need to finish my work from last week... so...</p>
