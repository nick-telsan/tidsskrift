    <p>It's been a minute. I've been doing stuff, but blogging hasn't been much of an interest. Let's take some time to review what I've been workign on, and what's next!</p>

    <h2>What I've been working on</h2>
    <p>July has been a month of working on old hobbies and scrambling to keep up with other things. I'll admit, I haven't been as productive as I could have been, but I've gotten a good bit done each weekend.</p>
    
    <h3>Candles and Bread</h3>
    <p>I like recycling and reusing stuff. I also like burning candles. So, I've been cleaning up old candle jars my wife and I had collected. I've been using the old wax, what I call "dubious wax", to make some new candles, but mostly, I bought a big ole bag of soy wax and a smaller bag of beeswax.</p>
    <p>For the past few weeks, I've made about a dozen candles - I think I have about 30 either curing or ready to go. Making candles is actually pretty fast in small batches, but cleaning them can take a while. Especially when the jars had stickers that I need to remove.</p>
    <p>I've also been baking bread regularly. My results are still pretty mixed. I made some half-decent sandwich bread, but it's still too heavy and crumbly. I've got a sourdough starter, but last time I tried to make sourdough, I placed the resting dough on top of my oven as it cooled down, and the radiating heat baked my dough a little (8 hours) early.</p>

    <h3>TTRPGs</h3>
    <p>I have <em>four</em> active games now...</p>
    <p>Facilities of Eisolan is my biweekly, long form campaign. I need to do a retrospective on our first chapter, but we're now four games into our second chapter. It's going well, but the party has no idea what is actually happening.</p>
    <p>Nightmare on the Coast is my monthly 4E game. It's a bit more of a mystery than FoE. In FoE, the players kinda know who the big bad is. At least, they have an idea. But, in NotC, they have no idea what is going on and are trying to make sense of a bunch of undead attacks. I'm excited to tell the rest of this story, but not in love with 4E as a long term system.</p>
    <p>Children of Drust is my seasonal, lite game. I'm debating on moving the party over to my Fate-like Legends system, but right now, the standard Champions system works fine. The party knows who the big bad is and where this is ultimately going, but this game is very episodic, with me dropping the players in the middle of a conflict at the start of each game.</p>
    <p>Finally, I'm just a regular player in a Dragon of Icepeak Spire game. I'm playing a gnomish dragonblood sorcerer who is in it for the change required to buy booze. I've only had one game with these guys, but it's been alright so far. I'm just trying not to rules lawyer them to death.</p>

    <h3>Other</h3>
    <p>Work has been fine. The project continues. Not much else exciting. I did a presentation on React and TypeScript, and I still need to write a blog post of our website. That's about it.</p>
    <p>We started up a book club that I will likely not have time for. We're reading Mort, which is a nice easy read, but I've run low on time due to the next thing.</p>
    
    <h3>School!</h3>
    <p>I am officially going back to school! Going to be working on my history degree and (hopefully) my CS degree.</p>
    <p>I'm pretty nervous about it. I'm only taking 1 class, but it's an 8 week class, so it's similar to 2 classes in a standard semester.</p>
    <p>If I do well in this first class and can balance life, wife, work, school, and fun, then I'll pick up more in the future.</p>
    <p>I'm sure I'll have more posts about school in the future, but I don't know much yet. Classes start in about a month, so during this next month, I'm working on developing some study habits.</p>

    <h2>What else?</h2>
    <p>I've got about 90% of a post written about rebuilding my map after some file corruption. I just need to finish it.</p>
    <p>Also, I'm probably going to finish some style stuff before I post this one.</p>
