      title="Facilities of Eisolan Chapter 1 Retrospective"
      date="2021-08-01"
    />

    <p>Shortly after we moved, we finished the first chapter of my homebrew game, Epics of Thalomir: Facilities of Eisolan. I hadn't really had a chance to do a retrospective on it, so... doing that now.</p>
    <p>I'm basically going to break this into the good, the bad, and the ugly.</p>
    <p>The good is stuff that worked well. The bad is stuff that didn't work as well (typically of no one's fault). The ugly is stuff I messed up (typically of my fault).</p>
    <p>Here we go</p>

    <h2>The Good</h2>
    <p>Compared to the start of Silverhammer Slammers, my previous campaign (and the Short T's, the campaign before it), Facilities started off wonderfully. Everyone had rich backstories with plenty for me to work with, the world was moderately fleshed out, and my system mastery is way better than it was 3 years ago.</p>
    <p>There are a couple things I want to highlight though: System flexing and unplanned narrative</p>

    <h3>System Flexing</h3>
    <p>I'm not a fan of 5e. Despite being the most flexible version of DnD to come out, it's still a very rigid system. In some ways, it's more rigid than the other systems I've played due to the 6 to 8 encounter requirement. I could rant about that for a while, but that's for another article.</p>
    <p>When I started planning FoE, I started the "Traveler's Guide to Thalomir", which was just a condensation of my preferred 5e homebrew and systems into a handy book, but after the finale of Silverhammer Slammers, I decided that I really didn't want to run another game with a required 8 encounter boilerplate. (Another article)</p>
    <p>So, in the month between our Session 0 and Session 1, I rewrote the class guides for each of the player's classes. This also belongs in another article. The results was the alpha version of the Champions of Silverhammer. Heavily based on 5e, but with only half the required encounters.</p>
    <p>All in all, I think this went well, but I wasn't done. Alpha was only a stop gap. Beta was already started. My blood hunter was a little bored of "I attack" once per turn, so I started working on some stuff for him. My rogue / fighter was struggling with multiclass effectively hindering her growth rate, so I started working on that, too.</p>
    <p>By the end of the chapter, I had ended up with the special attacks system, reimincent of 4e's abilities, but tied to weapons instead of class features, and the decoupling of feats, ability scores, and class levels. With player feedback, I was easily able to adjust to what they needed, and making the game fun for them is my top priority.</p>
    <p>Since the end of chapter 1, I've also double all spell damage to better match martial's power, and am still working on improving all classes in general.</p>

    <h3>Unplanned Narrative</h3>
    <p>I am not a narrator who runs entire improv games. My games are planned out pretty hard. I don't write down narrative (unless I want to make sure to say something particular and important), but I also don't use random encounters (another article...).</p>
    <p>However, just as I have had to flex my system, I've also had to flex my narrative, and I think it's worked pretty well.</p>
    <p>The first flex arose when the warlock's psuedodragon familiar managed to put a boss to sleep. The party thought it was best to not kill her while she couldn't defend herself, and took her prisoner instead. However, when they got back, they were basically told that she likely wouldn't go to prison for anything, since, you know, worshipping a god isn't illegal and also its just the party's word against hers.</p>
    <p>This caused the party to call an audible and try to find some evidence to incriminate her. They knew she was bad - she had admitted it to them - but that wasn't enough in the court of law as no one could prove she had actually said anything.</p>
    <p>Side bar: The party also tried to get her put in a Zone of Truth, which gave me the chance to explain why Zone of Truth is almost exclusively used by lawful evil characters (in character, also, another article?).</p>

    <p>The second case came up in much the same way. Our bard is currently being tracked down by some mercenaries hired by her father. A few of them found the party and were summarily stomped into the ground.</p>
    <p>The party allowed them to escape, so long as they didn't go back to their boss. This threw off my plan for our bard to come face to face with her first real big bad villan. So, I rolled with the punches and showed exactly how gruesome this guy is.</p>
    <p>After dealing with some of the more pressing matters, the party found this mercenary's camp, abandoned, with two corpses of the ambushers the party had spared, and one survivor. The last ambusher was left the day before, a spear through his belly set just so that he would die slowly.</p>
    <p>They knew the party was coming. I don't know if the party has realized this yet, but the mercenaries knew <em>when</em> they were coming. And yet, the mercenaries chose to flee... I'm excited to play out the rest of this story... It wasn't what I expected, but I think it will make this big bad more terrifying.</p>

    <h2>The Bad</h2>
    <p>Despite my best intentions, not everything worked out perfectly. There's only two things I want to touch on in this section: attacks and low levels. These are both system flaws that I didn't notice until it was too late to fix them.</p>

    <h3>Attacks (with low modifiers</h3>
    <p>Most tier one characters are sitting between +4 and +6 to hit. With this in mind, enemy AC tends to cap out in the low teens - 13 or so. This isn't really a problem, though it does mean that you can't use medium, heavy armor, or shields without risking your party never hitting their target (hey, another article).</p>
    <p>I knew this, and adjusted my monsters appropriately, but one of my player's has what I call shit luck. The irony is he's playing a tiefling born of the archdevil of luck. One night, he rolled a total of 7 attacks, and only 1 hit. One part of this is that the party talked their way out of an encounter, but that meant that for roughly two-thirds of the night, he felt like his turns were meaningless.</p>
    <p>I could feel his frustration. I've felt that frustration! The few times I've played, I've been the unluckiest bastard this side of the Styx. And though I can't change luck, I can at least give him more chances.</p>
    <p>The ultimate result of this is giving 1st level martial characters access to Extra Attack. Bam, twice the attacks. Statistically, they're more likely to hit, though statistics don't matter to the individual. I think this is the best I can do aside from pushing him towards saving throw based characters.</p>
    <p>The reason this is in the Bad and not the Good is because I didn't notice how bad the problem was until the party was 4th level.</p>

    <h3>Low Level Woes</h3>
    <p>I like starting at 1st level, but 5e's 1st level is worthless. Most characters are carrying about 10 hit points and most enemies deal around 4 damage on a hit. It's particulalry bad for the d6 classes who likely carry between 6 and 8 hit points. A high roll from a fodder enemy, and they're unconscious.</p>
    <p>Similarly, few classes have anything really fun at 1st level. Spells are too limited and abilities are too few and far between. Your turns are largely "I attack", and while that can be good for new players, it means slightly veteran players get bored easily.</p>
    <p>As a result, I tend to only run 1 game at 1st level, and about 2 at 2nd level.</p>
    <p>This worked fine, but it meant we spent most of the chapter at 3rd level. This wasn't a problem, but it felt kinda shitty to me. Ultimately, I'm working on a satisfactory solution my homebrew. I think it might be as simple as the Special Attacks I mentioned earlier and boosting hit points. Probably will be a year before I really get to find out, though...</p>

    <h2>The Ugly</h2>
    <p>Okay, maybe the Ugly is a bit hard on myself. These are things I did poorly and what I can do to fix it.</p>
  
    <h3>Distracted from the Threat</h3>
    <p>Facilities of Eisolan was introduced to the players as an exploration of the Underdark that would start by defending a little village from constructs and aberrations. While this did technically happen, we also got a bit off track.</p>
    <p>The chapter can basically be broken into three sections - the Initial Threat, the Party's Moments, and Return of the Threat.</p>
    <p>The Initial Threat was just an introduction to the constructs and aberrations in a relatively safe and on-the-rails environment. It was a good place for the players to learn each others characters, as well as their own, without having to worry too much about how their actions would change the overall narrative. 7/10, not bad, could use some improvemment.</p>
    <p>Could I do this section over again, I would have kept the first three adventures more closely tied. As it is, they are three distinct adventures with starts and stops. I think it should have been one long adventure that took place over three long rests. It also would result in reaching 2nd level instead of 3rd.</p>
    <p>The Party's Moments were individual character stories plus some D plots that I liked or they had shown some interest in.</p>
    <p>In hindsight, I should have either exclusively used my D plots, weaving in minor pieces of the character's backstories to create their C plots in the next chapter, or I should have only used my C plots.</p>
    <p>Sidebar: Narratively, I think of my campaign in four plot lines. The A plot is the singular plotline that brings the party together and lasts for most of the game. The B plot runs alongside the A plot, occasionally popping up to confuse or distract the players before hiding again. It is also usually resolved late in the game. The C plots are the character plots. They are slow burns that last from the early game until the late game, ending with the resolution of the character's peronsal goal completed. D plots are basically all other plotlines. Most are single adventures that somehow tie into an A, B, or C plot.</p>
    <p>In the future, I'll probably try first idea, utilizing the Rule of 3 to help the players notice their own plotlines starting. The second chapter, which has a bigger scope, is a bit better for most long term plotlines anyways.</p>
    <p>That brings us to Return of the Threat. This adventure took us just over 2 sessions to complete. Which is good for a single finale-level adventure, but isn't great for the entire return to the A plot. To me, this felt like jumping back into the main quest of Skyrim after starting the Dark Brotherhood. It was a bit disjointed for a party that now had other leads to follow.</p>
    <p>Largely, I think fixing this one is just fixing the Party's Moments so that those leads pointed back towards Eisolan and the Underdark.</p>
    <p>This is particularly tricky because the entire premise was that this underground kingdom had never been seen before... Now I've got four outside forces working within the Underdark.</p>
    <p>So, perhaps the problem doesn't lie within my organization of plotlines in the first chapter, but the entire premise of my campaign. It's something to consider, but we're in Eisolan now, so a little late to change all of that!</p>
  
    <h2>The Summary</h2>
    <p>Largely, I think I did pretty well. I'm enjoying where the campaign is going, even if it took a minute to get started the way I wanted. I've learned a lot already, and I know I'll learn a lot more as this campaign and my other campaigns continue.</p>
    <p>Until next time... peace out!</p>
