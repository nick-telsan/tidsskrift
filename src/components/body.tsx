      <Title>Welcome to n.evergrown</Title>
      <Text>
        Last year, I started Manticore's Garage, which was a resounding
        semi-success. I still think the idea is valid, but I want to do some
        things differently this year. Feel free to click through the headings
        below and read some of the stuff I've thought about lately.

      <CollapsibleHeading heading="The Tracker">
        <>
          <Text>
            The first thing you'll likely notice is the tracker on the left side
            of the screen. Right now, it's pretty sparse, seeing as how I'm
            writing this in 2021 and it doesn't start until 2022.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Right now, these are static, but I plan to get a basic API and
            database up soon to give me some easier-to-manage stats. Until then,
            I'll update them roughly once a week and / or when I publish a new
            article. Let's walk through all the stats.

          <Subheading>Yogas yoged</Subheading>
          <Text>
            How many times have I done yoga this year. My aim is to get to a
            place where I'm doing it once a day, but I've got to work up to
            there.
          </Text>
          <Subheading>Weight lost</Subheading>
          <Text>
            I don't have a solid goal weight right now. I need a doctor for
            that. But I do know I can stand to lose at least 30 lbs.
          </Text>
          <Subheading>Meals cooked</Subheading>
          <Text>Pretty straight foward. No hard goal.</Text>
          <Subheading>Hours worked</Subheading>
          <Text>
            Less of a goal, more of a tracking tool. I'll be using Toggl to keep
            up with my personal hours. I should be hitting around 40 a week,
            minus any vacation and holidays.
          </Text>
          <Subheading>Hours passioned</Subheading>
          <Text>
            I couldn't find a better label for this. It's working on my passion
            projects (like this!). I'm hoping for 20 to 40 hours a week.
          </Text>
          <Subheading>Hours gamed</Subheading>
          <Text>
            I hope to reduce this dramatically in 2022. Sub 20 hours a week.
          </Text>
          <Subheading>Pomos doroed</Subheading>
          <Text>
            My back has been hurting a lot due to sitting in roughly one
            position for 12+ hours a day. I am going to aim for 10 minutes of
            not sitting per 50 minutes of sitting. So basically, a Pomodoro
            break per hour working, passioning, or gaming.
          </Text>
          <Subheading>Commits committed</Subheading>
          <Text>No real goal here. I just think it will be a neat stat.</Text>
          <Subheading>Sessions run</Subheading>
          <Text>
            I'm hoping to run about 48 to 60 sessions of TTRPGs this year!

          <Subheading>Drawings drawn</Subheading>
          <Text>
            I'm working on learning to draw. It's never going to see the light
            of day, but I'm doing it!
          </Text>
          <Subheading>Candled canned</Subheading>
          <Text>No goal here either. I just think it will be a neat stat.</Text>
          <Subheading>Books read</Subheading>
          <Text>
            I messed this up last year by not including text books, only
            traditional "for pleasure" reading. This year, I'm including my text
            books. And also aiming for 1 a month.

            It has officially been 14 months since I started my new job. It's
            been a good year for work. I've spent all of it, literally all of it
            from November 2020 to January 2022, working on a COVID testing app.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            All in all, that hasn't been too bad. On Monday I'm starting a new
            project. It's literally the reason I'm playing around with Preact
            and Tailwind right now.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            But life isn't just work. Though my worklife has been fine, my
            outside-of-work life has struggled. Finances have been tough. Right
            now, I'm the only breadwinner, which is fine, I make enough money,
            but it's just enough money. I'm not to a place where we can thrive.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Speaking of thriving, part of the trouble is wanting our own space
            so badly. Rentals are growing old, to say the least, but it seems a
            fools errand to spend our money on another person's property. Our
            hope has been Colorado or maybe Vermont, but both are hella
            expensive and only getting worse. We'll see how that goes.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            In the meantime, my plan this year is to get some debt stuff under
            control, hope that Biden does away with student loans for good, and
            try not to worry too much.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Oh, speaking of worrying, in 2021, I royally messed up my PTO, so I
            probably won't have any time off work this year. Next year I hit the
            extra PTO milestone, but this year won't be fun in that regard.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            It's not all gloom and doom, though. We have our cats and our
            health. I've got a solid job that keeps us fed, clothed, housed, and
            does all of that well. Things really aren't too bad.

            Hoo boy do I have a lot I'd like to do this year... Let's get
            started.
          </Text>
          <Subheading>Facilities of Eisolan</Subheading>
          <Text>
            We're currently about 18 months into Facilities, but not quite where
            I wanted to be by this time. Some of that is just because scheduling
            is hard when you have 6 adults trying to play a game. I've
            alleviated some of that with retainers, but it's still not perfect.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            This year, we're going to try playing on the first three Mondays of
            the month. I hope to get about 36 sessions in this year, and be well
            into chapter 3 if not into chapter 4 by this time.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            So, why has it taken longer than expected? Well, again, some of it
            is just scheduling. Some of it is also due to the fact that I have
            five players, which means everything takes longer. Managing combat
            for 5 players means we might only get two combats per session
            instead of three. It also means more roleplaying moments.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            All things considered, we're about twelve adventures behind where
            I'd like to be. A lot of that is hang over from chapter 1 and a lot
            of it is adventures that were planned to be one session taking two
            full sessions.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Assuming our three sessions a month works out and the party doesn't
            bite with more roleplaying (which would also be acceptable), I see
            us finishing up this chapter in May / June.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Which should mean we get back on track by this time next year.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            The cool thing is that we don't actually need to get back on track.
            I'd like to finish up right round 3 years, but if we finish earlier
            or later by a couple of months, that's okay. If we stick with the
            three sessions a month, we'll have about two months of buffer.
          </Text>
          <Text>Anyways, I'm going to talk more about that later!</Text>
          <Subheading>Nightmares on the Coast</Subheading>
          <Text>
            Nightmares is a single session behind, which is fine. We're still
            going to be running this on the fourth Sunday of the month for the
            time being. It's only behind the because there's three months in a
            row that have Holidays that land close to the fourth Sunday. How
            dare our calendars suck?
          </Text>
          <Text>
            I think my players are having fun with Nightmares, but I cannot wait
            to be done with 4e. It just doesn't fit well with my narration
            style. There is lots of good in there, though. More on that later.
          </Text>
          <Subheading>Post Nightmares</Subheading>
          <Text>
            I'm hoping to run a Pathfinder 2e game after Nightmares. Theme is
            currently undecided. I'm thinking of either doing something with the
            halflings or the arakoa.
          </Text>
          <Subheading>Children of Drust</Subheading>
          <Text>
            This game was put on indefinite hiatus last year. I'm planning on
            finishing off the story with a mini-series using a Fate-like system.
          </Text>
          <Subheading>One Shots and Lore Building</Subheading>
          <Text>
            I've got 3 Slammers games left to run - Pith, Kelaren, and Chilst.
          </Text>
          <Text>Got big plans for all of those!</Text>
          <Text>
            Other than that, I'd like to expand on some Calamity-era lore.

          \<Subheading>Wirtshaus and Silverhammer</Subheading>
          <Text>
            The other big things to get done are the MVP of Wirtshaus and
            Silverhammer.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Wirtshaus is my webapp for managing players and a campaign. It's
            slow coming, mainly because I've been playing too much WoW.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Silverhammer is my fork of 5e. We're playing a proto-type right now.
            I'd like to get more stuff written down. Right now, I've got a lot
            in my head and in make-shift markdown files.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            My goal for both of these is for them to be useable by the end of
            this year.

            My biggest other project is going to be this, most likely.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            I plan to keep this version of tidsskrift (internal name of this
            site) on Preact / Tailwind for the entire year. Next year, I might
            move to something else completely, we'll see.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            I can definitely see the world in which I remove Tailwind in favor
            of my own styles and styled components.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            On the other hand, relying on Tailwind or a library like ChakraUI or
            MUI means I can spend more time working on things that are relevant
            to me and less time worrying about the basics of dialogs.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Definitely want to add more fun things to this site. Debating
            whether to go full CMS, full static, or just really embrace the CSA
            and get crazy with animations.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            I do want to take some screenshots of this 1.0 version of tidsskrift
            and see where I land by the end of 2022.
          </Text>
          <Subheading>And Other Stuff</Subheading>
          <Text>
            If I find the time, I'd like to build an identity microservice for
            all thigns evergrown. I have a few dumb ideas on the backlog as
            well.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Lastly, I'd like to take a picture a day of something. I think it
            would make my wife happy to have something like that at the end of
            the year.
